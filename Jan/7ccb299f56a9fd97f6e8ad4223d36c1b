18 May 2017It is with grave concern that the African National Congress has noted the increase in reports of mostly young women dying gruesome deaths at the hands of their intimate partners. These senseless and barbaric acts must be condemned by all in society and are an affront to our collective commitment to build a society where all people are and feel safe.The African National Congress calls on the South African Police Service to leave no stone unturned to find and bring to book the perpetrators of these heinous crimes. Society has a responsibility to ensure that the most vulnerable amongst us are protected at all times. We call on men in particular to reject and actively organize against this scourge which robs us of our mothers and sisters; our nation's pride.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries Zizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National Spokesperson Khusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Commications Manager
