26 July 2017The African National Congress congratulates the South African Police Service (SAPS) for a job well done following a drug bust in Soweto, Gauteng.In a statement issued by the Minister of Police, Comrade Fikile Mbalula, yesterday, 25 July 2017, members of the South African Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) searched a house in Dobsonville, "used as a clandestine laboratory linked to drugs supplied to the Western Cape", and found manufacturing equipment, tablet press, and chemicals for the manufacturing of Mandrax.This operation will go a long way in the national fight against manufacturing and use of drugs, which have a dire impact amongst young people - the future of our country. Whilst we congratulate all those involved in this drug bust, we equally call for the speedy prosecution and very harsh sentences for those who involved in the perpetuation of this heinous crime.Criminals have no place in our country. For us to achieve a drug free society, the ANC calls on all the people of South Africa to join in the fight against drugs. We all have a duty to jealously safeguard the future of our country, thus, we must all join hands and expose those who manufacture and sell drugs to our people, in particular the youth.We wish members of the SAPS strength as they continue with the good work of protecting the people of South Africa from crime.Issued by the African National Congress Enquiries Zizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National Spokesperson Khusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Communications Manager
