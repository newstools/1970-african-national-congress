A total of four wards were contested in, one Ward in each province, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Northern Cape.Due to the solid support the ANC continues to enjoy from the people of South Africa, the ANC successfully retained all three wards which were previously under our stewardship. Moreover, we extend our gratitude to the voters who ensured that we retain the highly contested Ward 07 in uPhongolo, KwaZulu-Natal, and increased our support base in Ward 15, Mnquma, Eastern Cape, and Ward 45, Mbombela, Mpumalanga. We do not take for granted the confidence the people have once again demonstrated in their movement and commit ourselves to redouble our efforts to work with them to solve the problems they face.We, once again, congratulate the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for delivering the credible, free and fair elections. We also thank our committed volunteers, members and supporters of the ANC who worked tirelessly in the build-up to these by-elections and ensured this decisive outcome.Issued by the African National Congress Enquiries Zizi Kodwa 0823304910 National Spokesperson Khusela Sangoni 0728545707 National Communications Manager
