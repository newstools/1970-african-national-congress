26 June 2017The African National Congress extends its very best wishes and wishes all our Muslim compatriots happy EID MUBARAK.EID is a significant religious celebration that has ended the month long dawn to dusk fast. As our Muslim brothers and sisters mark today by giving thanks, celebrating the spiritual enrichment and the ending of the journey of sacrifice, we also acknowledge the Muslim community's invaluable contribution to our democracy. Their steadfast and continued contribution to nation building and generosity to make our country a better place is honoured.As we join hands with our Muslim compatriots to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr, we also celebrate our rich cultural diversity as a nation committed to peace, democracy and unity. As this day also marks the 62nd anniversary of the Freedom Charter - the common program of the ANC, and erstwhile South African Indian Congress, Coloured People`s Congress, Congress of Trade Unions and the Congress of Democrats, may we once again mark the continuation of our journey of unity. The African National Congress calls on all of us to rededicate ourselves to the founding principles of our leaders before us and celebrate as one.Issued by the African National Congress Enquiries Zizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National Spokesperson Khusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Communications Manager
