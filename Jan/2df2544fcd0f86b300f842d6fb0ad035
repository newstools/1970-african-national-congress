28 November 2016The African National Congress will hold memorial services in Gauteng and the Western Cape in remembrance and honour of the former President of the Republic of Cuba and leader of the Cuban Revolution, Comrade Fidel Castro. Cde Fidel Castro was one of the greatest revolutionaries of our time, a great friend and ally of the ANC, the alliance, the broader national liberation movement and the people of South Africa as a whole. He was with us throughout the period of heightened repression by the apartheid regime and throughout the 30 year period of exile, underground armed struggle and international isolation of the apartheid regime, right from the victory of the Cuban revolution in 1959.During the exile days, Cuba opened the doors of its schools and universities for the education of many South Africans and their children who were in the liberation movement. Even today, Cuba continues to support our struggle for the reconstruction and development of our country. There are many Cuban doctors that are serving in our hospitals and clinics, often in the most remote areas of our country. In addition, there are 3000 South African student doctors who are currently studying in Cuba and this is twice the number of doctors that we graduate in South Africa every year.The ANC is of the view that much as we should mourn the passing away of Cde Fidel, we should also be celebrating his life, his role and contribution in building a better life for all of humanity.Members of the media are advised of the memorial services in honour of this internationalist and anti-imperialist of note, which will be held as follows:Western Cape Date: Wednesday, 30 November 2016 Time: 18h00 Venue: OR Tambo Community Hall, Khayelitsha Keynote Speaker: ANC Deputy President, Cde Cyril RamaphosaGauteng Date: Wednesday, 30 November 2016 Time: 14h00 Venue: Johannesburg City Hall, Johannesburg Keynote Speaker: ANC Secretary General, Cde Gwede MantasheIssued by Zizi Kodwa National Spokesperson African National CongressEnquiries Khusela Sangoni 072 854 5707
