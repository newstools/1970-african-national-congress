21 April 2017The African National Congress (ANC) is gravely saddened by the passing of 20 school pupils who were killed in a heartbreaking accident near Bronkhorspruit, Gauteng today.It is a sad day for South Africa, and a chilling reminder that despite the best efforts of our road traffic enforcement authorities, the numbers of lives lost to accidents on our roads remains worryingly high.Initial reports suggest that the minibus taxi in which the pupils were being transported collided with a truck. The ANC commends emergency and fire services as well as members of the community who were on the scene to attend to the injured. Regretfully despite all efforts at rescue, the learners died on the scene. South Africa has one of the highest road mortality rates in the world. Far too many lives are being lost and the organization calls for a full and exhaustive enquiry into the circumstances surrounding this accident.The African National Congress extends its deepest condolences to the bereaved families and calls on ANC structures and government to provide all the necessary assistance to them at this difficult time.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries: Khusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Communications Manager
