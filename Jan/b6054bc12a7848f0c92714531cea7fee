09 March 2017The African National Congress has noted the proliferation on social media and other platforms of "leaked" documents purporting to be ANC Policy Documents towards the National Policy Conference to be held in June this year. The African National Congress is in the process of finalizing its Policy Documents which, once finalized, will be launched to the public this coming Sunday, 12 March 2017. The so-called "leaked" or draft documents have no standing in the ANC and we will therefore will not be commenting on them.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries Zizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National SpokespersonKhusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Communications Manager
