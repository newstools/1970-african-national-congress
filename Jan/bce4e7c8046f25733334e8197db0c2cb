The African National Congress (ANC) notes information being disseminated on social media platforms regarding arrangements for the broadcast of the organization's 105th birthday celebrations to be held at Orlando Stadium on January 8th 2017.It has become necessary to clarify the arrangements currently in place, agreed to by the country's 3 major broadcasters (ENCA, SABC and ANN7) in a number of technical meetings convened by the ANC as part of our preparations. It is regrettable that the incorrect information being circulated on social media has served to create confusion and impute sinister motive to the organization.Broadcasters have been informed that the ANC will provide a live feed from the 105th birthday celebrations at Orlando Stadium; available for all media to use at no cost. This is the same arrangement we had at the Siyanqoba Rally in August 2016, to no objection from the very same broadcasters. This is common practice for the convening of large events around the world, including sports, political and other events. It is also a practice utilized by the United Nations and other multilateral organizations. The provision of a central feed makes it easier for broadcasters to obtain a diversity of footage of the event. All accredited broadcasters are allowed one camera on the pitch, which is also standard and common practice at the hosting of large events of this magnitude. We have since agreed that they made have an additional camera as per their request; demonstrating our openness to meeting their requirements as and when they are raised with us. Contrary to the disingenuous position being touted by some in the media.It is also incorrect that broadcasters will not be permitted to conduct interviews with the audience as so-called 'vox pops' as this has been agreed to in a technical meeting held on 6 January 2017.Furthermore, feeds from pitch cameras will not be 'monitored' as some have claimed on social media.The ANC encourages all broadcasters and the media at large to contact the organization should they require clarity on the broadcasting arrangements, instead of undue speculation.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiriesZizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National Spokesperson Khusela Sangoni 072 854 5707
