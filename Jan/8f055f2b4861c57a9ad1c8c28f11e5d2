25 May 2017The African National Congress welcomes the release of results of the by-elections held in two provinces yesterday, 24 May 2017. 18 wards were contested in 2 provinces, 17 in KwaZulu-Natal and 1 in the Western Cape.We would like to take this opportunity and congratulate the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) for, once again, delivering the credible, free and fair elections, in which we can all have confidence in.The ANC appreciates the support it received in a number of wards it retained. Even though we have never outrightly won the Nquthu Municipality, we are nonetheless disappointed with the loss of majority in wards in the municipality.The ANC extends its gratitude to the volunteers, members and supporters of the movement who worked tirelessly in the build-up to these by-elections. The ANC will go back to the people and continue engaging them on the challenges they are faced with and the role, working together, we can play to realize a better life for all in Nquthu.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries Zizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National SpokespersonKhusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Communications Manager
