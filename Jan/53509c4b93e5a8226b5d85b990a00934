8 March 2017The African National Congress joins the global community in marking the International Women's Day today, 08 March 2017, under the theme "Be Bold For Change". This day provides an opportunity for the international community to actively participate in driving greater change for women and to accelerate gender parity globally.The day also provides us with an opportunity to celebrate and to reflect on the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. Thanks to the policies of the African National Congress, working with the people of South Africa, women in South African can now occupy multiplicity of roles, including as entrepreneurs, politicians, teachers, in civil society and our communities - liberated from the bondage of legislated patriarchy. Notwithstanding these successes, grievances of women remain including gender based violence, economic marginalization, residual cultural and traditional prejudices and access to services. Poverty, in particular, continues to wear a dress in South Africa - with the most vulnerable in our country being female and African in the majority.As stated in the 2017 January 8th statement, women of this country, throughout the ages, have proven to be strong and resilient in the face of challenges and triumphs. We remain confident that, led by women themselves and working with all progressive allies to the women's cause, South Africa can will and do more to dismantle structures of entrenched patriarchal oppression, accelerate gender parity, economic inclusion and build a country where all feel and are safe.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries Zizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National SpokespersonKhusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Communications Manager
