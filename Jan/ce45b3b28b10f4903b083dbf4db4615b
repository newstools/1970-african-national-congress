13 April 2017The African National Congress wishes all those in South Africa celebrating Easter a blessed, peaceful and meaningful Easter with their families, friends and loved ones. Easter is a time for reflection and rejuvenation following as it does the Lent period of prayer and repentance.The ANC calls on all road users - including in public transport and as pedestrians - who may be traveling during this period to exercise caution and restraint on our roads. The rules of the road are not mere suggestions or guidelines but directives that all on our roads should obey. When feeling exhausted, we urge drivers to take time to rest remembering always that speed kills.During this time when many amongst us would want to spend this solemn time in places of worship and with family and loved ones, the ANC is concerned about the ongoing strike in the bus industry which has left many commuters stranded, unable to get to their destinations. Whilst respecting the legitimate grievances of the workers, we urge all parties to return to the negotiating table to resolve this impasse.We once again wish all those observing this period contemplation of the continued suffering of others and the role that society and the Church can and should play in our moral rejuvenation as a nation.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries Khusela Sangoni 0728545707
