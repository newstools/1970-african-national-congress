10 March 2017The African National Congress has noted the News24 report entitled "Prasa locomotive contractor paid ANC fundraisers". Not only is this so-called "exclusive" story old hat and a rehash and regurgitation of the same story run by the same news outlet on the 11th April 2016, but it is an unimaginative and frankly tired effort to link the ANC to the misdeeds at the Passenger Rail Agency.The ANC once again refutes these scandalous claims and rejects any allegations that the organisation was funded by the individuals claimed. We once again condemn in the harshest possible terms rumour-mongering and the use of the name of the organisation between individuals in their personal deals with no mandate from the organisation.The ANC calls upon those involved in the challenges confronting PRASA to commit themselves to finding suitable and sustainable solutions to the challenges facing the Agency. At the core of this must be establishing the truth on such matters without casting unfortunate, untruthful and malicious aspersions on the ANC, which is not involved in this matter.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries Zizi Kodwa 0823304910 National SpokespersonKhusela Sangoni 0728545707 National Communications Manager
