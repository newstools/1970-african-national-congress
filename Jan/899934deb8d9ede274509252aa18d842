11 May 2017The African National Congress notes with disbelief actions of the Northern Cape Premier, Comrade Sylvia Lucas, to reshuffle her cabinet without any consultation with the ANC yesterday, 10 May 2017.We view this as a flagrant abuse of her office to further divide the ANC and undermine unity of the organisation. Her unbridled arrogance is a betrayal of trust with the ANC - the organisation that deployed her as Premier.We reaffirm the 52nd National Conference resolution, that consultation with the ANC structures on matters of deployment is a principle of the organisation and not a favor. Our deployees must desist from misusing their deployment to deepen divisions in the ANC.Issued by the African National CongressEnquiries Zizi Kodwa 082 330 4910 National SpokespersonKhusela Sangoni 072 854 5707 National Communications Manager
