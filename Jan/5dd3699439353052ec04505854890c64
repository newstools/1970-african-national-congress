1st December 2016On World AIDS Day, the African National Congress commends the progress achieved by all sectors of society in pushing back HIV, AIDS and TB and calls on all South Africans to continue working together to secure an AIDS-free generation.Inspired by the emphasis in the Freedom Charter on preventative health, the ANC has led our nation's effort - the largest globally - to provide information, support and care that have progressively reduced the burden, reduced stigma and increased care for persons infected with and affected by HIV, AIDS and TB.At the same time, shifting social dynamics are producing worrying levels of new infections, which challenge us not to let down our guard.Prevention must remain our primary objective. South Africans must examine their behaviour, must respect their own bodies and the rights and bodies of intimate partners.We must end the sexual exploitation of girls and young women and must condemn so-called blessers as exploiters and abusers instead of trivialising and glamourising this social scourge.All in society should concern themselves and commit themselves to ensuring young girls are blessed with education, skills and economic opportunities, not with sex and sexually transmitted infections like HIV.Information, abstention, fidelity, condoms and circumcision remain our key defences against the epidemic and will ultimately help us attain an HIV-free generation.Once again, the ANC calls upon our young people to protect themselves from sexually transmitted infections and to lead healthy lifestyles.It is in our hands!Issued by Zizi Kodwa National Spokesperson African National CongressEnquiries Khusela Sangoni 072 854 5707
